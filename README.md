# Almaz Suleymanov' comparing of efficiency of distributed and synchronous calculations
## Purpose
Compare the efficiency and speed for those two types of calculations: 
1. **Synchronous**: the simplest straightforward way to do calculations without using threads, etc
2. **Distributed**: not that easy as this approach has to handle all the network communications and synchronisation of multiple calculating units
